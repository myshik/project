An elegant and simple solution to HiDPI based social icons with fallback to regular gif icons for IE8

== Description ==

This simple plugin that allows you to easily insert HiDPI ready social media icons in your WordPress powered site.

After installing the plugin you'll go to the Creativ Social Settings page under Settings in WordPress admin. On this page simply enter the FULL URL's of your social media profiles for the services you use. If you do not enter a URL, then that social media icon will not display.

Once you've added your URLs, you will need to make them display in your site, either of these methods can be used:

* You can display using PHP - `<?php echo creativsocial_icons_template(); ?>`
* Alternatively, you can insert the icons with a `[creativsocial]` shortcode anywhere you'd like, an example being in a widget area using a text widget in WordPress.

**Social Media Sites Included:**

* Dribbble
* Facebook
* Flickr
* Github
* Google Plus
* Instagram
* LinkedIn
* Pinterest
* RSS
* Tumblr
* Twitter
* Vimeo
* WordPress
* Youtube
