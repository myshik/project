Plugin themes switcher - allows your visitors to Almaz CMS to choose a template, in which will work with the site.

It works on the basis of the sessions and cookies. User change the theme design gets cookies, which determined that script should put the site in this template.
Therefore, IF WHEN TESTING IS ERROR OCCURRED, for example, you changed to a design theme, but not inserted in her block themes switcher, то, To return the default theme in your browser, CLEAR COOKIES!

NOTE: implemented two versions of work the plugin:
1. templates in themes switcher selected from all available in the folder templates. (pitfalls: all patterns in the templates folder must have block of plugin ... See below)
2. in themes switcher only those templates that you specify in the configuration (const.php), established in an array $tpl (prescribe carefully if config write to aaa and the template is in a folder aab - the plugin will look for a folder of aaa, and as a result of the user chose this design, the site does not receive the design, so it is best if the activation patterns to verify their correct working visually.)

In order to use the plugin, except for activation in a configuration file required in everyone templates who works, insert in the sidebar following line to display the form template choices:

<?php if(TPL===1) { ?><li><?php include (SPATH.'plugins/themes_switcher/switcher.php'); ?></li><?php } ?>
